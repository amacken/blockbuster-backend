Your project should be an app that:

Has an idea and technical stack (including database and server)
Is hosted somewhere on the internet
Demonstrates your ability to teach yourself something new!



Technologies Used:

For this project I decided to use the MERN stack (Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and React) and pulled data from the OMDB external API. I alo implemented user authorization using JWT.

Unsolved Problems and Future Goals:

There were a lot of issues I encountered throughout this project that didn't allow me to implement everything that was originally planned before the project deadline. If given more time, I would like to implement additional models/controllers where users can create saved lists for whatever they want - movies they own, their watch list, etc. I would also like to implement a more advanced user authentication/login process where each user who logs in has their own personal and customizable experience.
